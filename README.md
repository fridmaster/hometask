Welcome to the Awesome Test Task Project! This project showcases the power of React, Vite, and Vitest for building and testing web applications. 

## Features ✨

In the project, there are several TODOs identified for future improvements. 
It's important to note that if the project is significant in scope, 
such as a large-scale project rather than a simple home assignment, these TODOs would be adequately covered.
